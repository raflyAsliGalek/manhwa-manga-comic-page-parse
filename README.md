This repository contains my personal English translations of various manga, manhwa, and comics that I read for my own enjoyment.

This repository may contain:

* Plain text files (.txt) of the translated dialogues and narration.
* Markdown files (.md) containing the translated text, potentially organized by chapter or page.
* Potentially, notes or glossaries related to specific terms or cultural nuances.
* In some cases, I might include image files of the original comics alongside the translations for context (depending on storage and personal workflow).
